<b>Stekkie: Client part</b>

The third and the final project during our Ironhack bootcamp. Stekkie is a plant swapping app, where users can sign up to offer their plants they want to swap.
In the marketplace the user will be able to see all other plants and have the possibility to filter them by name or by distance. If an user wants to filter the plants by distance, he will be able to see the plants on a map thanks to the intergration with the GoogleMpasApi.

<b>Used technologies:</b>

React | Express | NodeJS | MongoDB | Bootstrap | CSS | HTML

APIs: GoogleMaps API, Treffle Plant API

You can check the application here: https://stekkie.netlify.app/

<b>Created by:</b> 
Yvana Wagter and Sybille Kasslatter - two students of Ironhack Bootcamp in Amsterdam in April 2020.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
